# STAT-451-Final-Project

I explored the homelessness issue in King County, where Seattle is located. 

I began with an overview of the homelessness problem in the U.S. and showed the distribution and the trend of homelessness in the U.S. I expected to turn the reader's attention to King County by comparing the homelessness rate in King County with the national level. Then, I explored the demographical pattern of the homeless population in King County, including race, age, and gender. I also investigated the geographical pattern of the homeless population to identify if specific neighborhoods are more affected. Finally, I explored the health and social services available to the homeless population, including their distribution in King County and their development in recent years.

# Datasets
## PIT Estimates by County
This dataset disaggregates and imputes matching for Point-In-Time (PIT) estimates at the CoC level to the County level. Dr. Almquist from the University of Washington created this dataset and published it in _Almquist, Z. W., N. E. Helwig, and Y. You (2020). Connecting Continuum of Care Point-in-Time Homeless Counts to United States Census Areal Units. Mathematical Population Studies 27(1), 46â€“58._. The dataset is available in R at https://github.com/SSDALab/CoCHomeless.

## PIT Estimates by State and by CoC
This dataset contains PIT estimates of homelessness by state and by CoC from 2007 - 2022. The Department of Housing and Urban Development created and published this dataset. It is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/.
