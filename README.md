# STAT-451-Final-Project

I explore the homelessness issue in King County, where Seattle is located. 

I begin with an overview of the homelessness problem in the US and show the distribution and the trend of homelessness in the US. I expect to turn the reader's attention to King County by comparing the homelessness rate in King County with the national level. Then, I explore the demographical pattern of the homeless population in King County, including race, age, and gender. I also investigate the geographical pattern of the homeless population to identify if specific neighborhoods are more affected. Finally, I explore the health and social services available to the homeless population, including their distribution in King County and their development in recent years.

I use datasets about homelessness counts and surveys for the US and King County. I also need datasets that associate the homelessness data with regions like census regions to explore the geographical pattern. I will use datasets from the continuum-of-care program and other government institutions that provide social services.
