# Part 2 Unfinished Yet - STAT-451-Final-Project

I explored the homelessness issue in King County, where Seattle is located. 

I began with an overview of the homelessness problem in the U.S. and showed the distribution and the trend of homelessness in the U.S. I expected to turn the reader's attention to King County by comparing the homelessness rate in King County with the national level. Then, I explored the demographical pattern of the homeless population in King County, including race, age, and gender. I also investigated the geographical pattern of the homeless population to identify if specific neighborhoods are more affected. Finally, I explored the health and social services available to the homeless population, including their distribution in King County and their development in recent years.

# Datasets
## County_2017den.csv - PIT Estimates by County
This dataset disaggregates and imputes matching for Point-In-Time (PIT) estimates at the CoC level to the County level. Dr. Almquist from the University of Washington created this dataset and published it in _Almquist, Z. W., N. E. Helwig, and Y. You (2020). Connecting Continuum of Care Point-in-Time Homeless Counts to United States Census Areal Units. Mathematical Population Studies 27(1), 46â€“58._. The dataset is available in R at https://github.com/SSDALab/CoCHomeless.

## 2007-2022-PIT-Counts-by-CoC.xlsx - PIT Estimates by State and by CoC
This dataset contains PIT estimates of homelessness by state and by CoC from 2007 - 2022. The Department of Housing and Urban Development created and published this dataset. It is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/.

# Analysis
## Geographical Distribution of the Rate of Homelessness by Counties
This graph shows the rate of homelessness in 2017 for every county in the US using a map with colors, where the rate of homelessness is defined as the estimated number of homeless individuals divided by the total population and multiplied by 10,000. It allows a large-scale exploration of the geographical distribution of the rate of homelessness in the US. We can see that the homelessness issue is widely prevalent in most regions. In particular, the West Coast of the US, on average, has a higher rate of homelessness. The rate is also higher in urban and suburban areas.
